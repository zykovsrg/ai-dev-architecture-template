## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Structured recurrence input as alternative to RRULE strings (#168) — accept `{"frequency": "weekly", "interval": 2, "days_of_week": ["MO"], "count": 10}` alongside RRULE strings
- `recurrence_parsed` field in get_events return — structured representation of recurrence rules for easier model consumption
- Absolute date alarms: `{"type": "absolute", "date": "ISO 8601"}` fires at a fixed time (#167)
- Proximity-based alarms: `{"type": "proximity", "proximity": "enter"|"leave"}` geofence alerts requiring structured_location (#167)
- Typed alert objects in get_events return with `type` field (relative/absolute/proximity)
- Rule-based automated eval scoring in `run_eval.py` — no model self-scoring bias (#266)
- Server instructions for finding events ("Use get_events or search_events") and missing information ("ask for clarification") (#270)
- 48 blind eval scenarios (was 38), all 10 tools now covered (#266, #271)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed `clear_location`, `clear_notes`, `clear_url`, `clear_alerts`, `clear_recurrence` flags from update_events (#269) — pass empty values instead (e.g., `location=""`, `alerts=[]`, `recurrence=""`)
- Tool descriptions accept `search_events` as valid alternative to `get_events` for UID lookup (#270)
- Stronger allday event guidance with concrete examples in tool descriptions (#270)
- `"unavailable"` added to documented availability values (#265)
- `is_editable` and `is_organizer` fields documented in get_events return (#265)

### Fixed

- Flaky `test_reschedule_single_occurrence`: use `occurrence_date` field (not `start_date`) for occurrence lookup, add EventKit sync delay (#260)
- Auto-scorer false positives: accept `search_events` as valid for UID lookup (~15 false PARTIALs fixed) (#270)
- f-string syntax error in `run_eval.py` print_summary (#266)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Critic review of test suite completeness and quality (#149) — 51 findings across unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks, and blind evals
- Unit test mocks updated to match real Swift helper output: `type`, `is_default`, `calendar_name` fields (#228)
- 21 new unit tests covering previously-untested code paths: backward-compat kwarg alias, error codes, `calendar_source`, `occurrence_date`, tentative availability, formatter fields (#229)
- Batch size boundary tests at exactly 50 items for create/update/delete (#230)
- `get_conflicts` integration tests, benchmark, and eval scenario (#231)
- `search_events` expanded: notes/location matching, zero-result query, all-calendars search, benchmark, eval scenarios (#232)
- Explicit calendar safety guard tests — `CalendarSafetyError` now deliberately triggered (#233)
- `update_events` tests for `clear_notes`, `clear_url`, `clear_alerts`, availability updates, and explicit timezone round-trip (#234)
- Benchmark improvements: warm-up phase, std deviation, batch create scaling, `--output` JSON flag, increased write iterations (#235)
- Dynamic date generation in tests — replaces 220+ hard-coded 2026-2028 dates with `_future_date()` helper (#236)
- 6 new eval scenarios: `create_calendar`, `delete_calendar` (safety-critical), recurring-event deletion safety, multi-calendar `get_events`, under-specified requests (#237)
- Standardized eval scoring rubric with PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL definitions and rule-based automated scoring in `run_eval.py` (#238)
- Multi-calendar `get_availability` integration test and benchmark (#241)
- `create_tag.sh` now runs pre-tag hygiene checks before creating tags (#75)
- GitHub Actions added to Dependabot monitoring (#110)

### Fixed

- `fresh_calendar` fixture hardened against teardown failure with try/finally guard (#239)
- `delete_calendar` eval tool description: added missing `calendar_source` parameter (#237)
- Eval scenarios 4 and 24: removed date-anchored expected params that broke on re-runs (#237)
- Field-clearing eval scenarios 23 and 27: populated empty `key_params` (#238)

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- SECURITY.md: threat model, operational security, prompt injection risk, architecture security properties (#210, #215, #216, #219, #224, #225)
- Ambiguous calendar rejection: write operations fail when duplicate calendar names exist without `calendar_source` (#212, #221)
- `calendar_source` parameter on `delete_calendar` for source disambiguation (#212, #221)
- Per-call batch size limit of 50 for `create_events`, `update_events`, `delete_events` (#214, #223)
- CLI argument prefix validation: calendar names and UIDs starting with `--` are rejected (#217, #226)
- `EVENT CONTENT` warning in server instructions about untrusted event data (#215, #224)

### Fixed

- `create_events` safety bypass when `calendar_name` is empty — now blocked in test mode (#213, #222)

### Changed

- OpenRouter API key moved from `.env` to macOS Keychain in eval runner (#209, #218)
- Calendar-not-found errors no longer enumerate all available calendars (#211, #220)
- `ambiguous_calendar` error mapped to `ValueError` in Swift helper error handling (#212, #221)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Source-aware disambiguation: `calendar_source` parameter on `create_events`, `update_events`, `delete_events` for targeting specific accounts when calendar names are duplicated (#200, #205)
- `get_conflicts` and `get_availability` accept empty `calendar_names` for all-calendar queries, matching `get_events` pattern (#202, #206)

### Fixed

- Recurring event deletion warning strengthened: "may affect" → "WILL delete all occurrences." Added guidance to check `is_recurring` before deleting (#199, #204)
- Documented `allday=true` requirement when updating dates on all-day events (#201, #207)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Structured location support: geo coordinates, radius, map pins via `EKStructuredLocation` (#175, #176)
- Event organizer details: `organizer_name`, `organizer_email`, `organizer_status` (#163, #169)
- Creation/modification timestamps: `created_date`, `modified_date` (#164, #169)
- Event timezone read-back: returns IANA identifier for cross-timezone events (#166, #174)
- Default calendar: `is_default` field in `get_calendars`, `calendar_name` optional on `create_events` (#165, #173)
- Calendar name in `_format_event` output for search → update/delete chaining (#171, #172)
- Cross-calendar queries: `get_events` and `search_events` accept `calendar_names: list[str]` (#185, #191)
- Unimplemented capabilities audit in gap analysis (#161, #162)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `get_events` and `search_events`: `calendar_name` → `calendar_names` (list, optional, empty = all calendars) (#185, #191)
- **Breaking:** `create_events`/`update_events` JSON input: `start`/`end` → `start_date`/`end_date` (matches get_events output) (#178, #187)
- **Breaking:** `delete_events`: `event_uid` → `event_uids` (matches connector, plural behavior) (#180, #189)
- `get_availability` and `get_conflicts` now use single Swift call instead of per-calendar Python loop (#185, #191)
- Cyclomatic complexity reduced: `get_availability` 19→6, `search_events` 14→4, via 6 extracted helpers (#158, #193)
- Release skill expanded to 12 phases with test coverage, code review, and documentation review gates (#160, #196)

### Fixed

- Stale disambiguation guidance in `tool_descriptions.md`: "use description" → "use source field" (#177, #186)

### Changed

- **API consolidation:** `create_event` → `create_events`, `update_event` → `update_events` (10 tools, down from 12). Single events use 1-element arrays. (#143, #152, #144, #155)
- All-day event `end_date` is now inclusive — a single March 15 event has end_date="2026-03-15" (#142, #151)
- `get_availability` respects event availability status — "free" events no longer block time (#124, #126)
- Calendar create/delete migrated from AppleScript to Swift/EventKit with explicit source assignment (#153, #154)
- Tool descriptions improved based on blind eval failures: date range semantics, timezone guidance (#145, #156)
- Architecture fully migrated to Swift/EventKit — no more AppleScript for any operation

### Fixed

- Test calendar infrastructure: calendars now persist reliably via EventKit source assignment (#153, #154)

- `update_event` tool (use `update_events` with 1-element array) (#144, #155)
- `create_event.swift` and `update_event.swift` (logic ported to batch helpers)
- `_escape_applescript_string` (no longer needed — all operations use EventKit)
