# Apple Calendar API Gap Analysis

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**macOS:** Darwin 25.3.0
**Calendar.app:** v16.0

## Research Method

Tested AppleScript and JXA (JavaScript for Automation) against a live Calendar.app instance with 15 calendars and 5600+ events. All tests were read-only.

Note: `sdef /Applications/Calendar.app` requires full Xcode (not just Command Line Tools). No SDEF file found in the app bundle. Research conducted via empirical AppleScript/JXA testing.

## Calendar Object

### Accessible Properties

| Property | Batch Access | Individual Access | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| `name` | ✅ `name of every calendar` | ✅ | Names are NOT unique (two "Family" calendars from different accounts) |
| `writable` | ✅ `writable of every calendar` | ✅ | `false` for subscribed/read-only calendars (Holidays, Birthdays, Siri Suggestions, TripIt, MedHub) |
| `description` | ✅ `description of every calendar` | ✅ | Often contains account email or service identifier |
| `color` | ✅ `color of every calendar` | ✅ | AppleScript: 16-bit RGB integers (3 values per calendar). JXA: 0-1 float RGB values |

### Inaccessible Properties

| Property | Error | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `uid` | AppleEvent handler failed (-10000) | **Critical:** Cannot uniquely identify calendars. Must use name-based lookup. |
| `id` | AppleEvent handler failed (-10000) | Same as uid |
| `properties` | AppleEvent handler failed (-10000) | Cannot get all properties at once. Must fetch individually. |

### Workaround for Calendar Identification

Since UIDs are inaccessible, calendars must be identified by name. For duplicate names, the `description` field (which often contains account info) can disambiguate. The API should document this limitation clearly.

---

## Event Object

### Accessible Properties (tested on individual events)

| Property | Access | Type/Format | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `summary` | ✅ | string | Event title |
| `start date` | ✅ | date → `"Monday, April 3, 2023 at 10:35:00 AM"` | Locale-dependent format |
| `end date` | ✅ | date → same format | |
| `uid` | ✅ | string UUID `"3290DD8F-17E9-4DCC-B5FA-764655253E7A"` | **Works for events** (unlike calendars) |
| `allday event` | ✅ | boolean | |
| `description` | ✅ | string | Event notes/body |
| `location` | ✅ | string | |
| `url` | ✅ | string or `missing value` | |
| `status` | ✅ | enum: `none`, `confirmed`, `tentative`, `cancelled` | |
| `recurrence` | ✅ | string (RRULE) or `missing value` | iCalendar RRULE format |
| `excluded dates` | ✅ | list of dates or empty | For recurring event exceptions |
| `stamp date` | ✅ | date | Last modified timestamp |
| `sequence` | ✅ | integer (0-based) | iCalendar sequence number |
| `attendees` | ✅ (element) | list of attendee objects | Can query count; individual properties need testing |

### Date Format

AppleScript returns: `"Monday, April 3, 2023 at 10:35:00 AM"`

This differs from OmniFocus format (`"March 5, 2026 5:00:00 PM"`) — includes day name and uses "at" separator. The date format is **locale-dependent** and may vary by system settings.

JXA returns native JavaScript Date objects which support `.toISOString()` — but JXA has the same property access failures on calendars.

---

## Performance

### Critical Finding: `whose` Clause Timeout

```applescript
-- TIMED OUT on calendar with 5602 events:
every event of cal whose start date ≥ today and start date < (today + 30 * days)
```

This is a blocking issue for `get_events`. Potential strategies:
1. **Narrower date windows** — test with shorter ranges
2. **Batch property access** — `summary of events 1 thru N of cal` (tested: works for first 3)
3. **JXA with index-based access** — timed out on first event of large collection
4. **EventKit via PyObjC** — alternative to AppleScript, direct framework access (future investigation)

### What Works

- `count of events of cal` — fast, returns 5602 instantly
- `name of every calendar` — fast, all 15 calendars
- `event N of cal` — direct index access works for specific events
- Individual property access on specific events — fast

### IPC Cost Estimate

Per OmniFocus benchmarks: ~17ms per property read. Calendar likely similar. With 10 properties per event × 100 events = ~17 seconds. Minimizing property reads is critical.

### Solution: EventKit via Swift Helper

The `whose` clause timeout was resolved by implementing a Swift helper (`src/apple_calendar_mcp/swift/get_events.swift`) that uses EventKit's `EKEventStore` with native predicate-based queries. This provides sub-second reads on any calendar size.

### Benchmarks (2026-03-16, 16 calendars, Work calendar: 1376 events)

| Operation | Method | Time | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| `get_calendars` | AppleScript (batch) | ~6.4s | Slow — 16 calendars, batch property reads |
| `get_events` (1 month) | EventKit/Swift | ~0.4s | Fast — native predicate filtering |
| `get_events` (1 year) | EventKit/Swift | ~0.5s | Scales well |
| `get_events` (10 years, 1376 events) | EventKit/Swift | ~0.8s | Sub-second even for large ranges |
| `get_availability` (1 month) | EventKit + Python | ~0.4s | Inherits get_events performance |
| `get_availability` (1 year) | EventKit + Python | ~0.5s | |
| `create_event` | AppleScript | ~1.7s | Single event, acceptable |
| `update_event` | AppleScript (`whose uid`) | ~2.6s | UID lookup + property set |
| `delete_events` (single) | AppleScript (`whose uid`) | ~2.4s | Single UID lookup |
| `delete_events` (batch, 5) | AppleScript (`whose uid` × 5) | ~14.5s | Linear scaling, N separate invocations |

**Key observations:**
- **Read operations (EventKit)** are sub-second regardless of calendar size
- **Write operations (AppleScript)** are 1–3s per operation due to IPC overhead
- **Batch delete scales linearly** — each UID requires a separate AppleScript invocation
- **get_calendars is surprisingly slow** at ~6.4s for AppleScript batch property reads
- Write performance is acceptable for typical single-event use (create, update, delete one)
- Batch delete of 10+ events may feel slow; consider EventKit migration if this becomes a common use case

---

## Write Operations

All write operations implemented and tested via AppleScript:

| Operation | AppleScript Command | Status | Timing |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Create calendar | `make new calendar with properties {name:"X"}` | ✅ Implemented (test setup) | <1s |
| Create event | `make new event at end of events of cal with properties {...}` | ✅ Implemented | ~1.7s |
| Update event | `set summary of evt to "X"` (via `whose uid`) | ✅ Implemented | ~2.6s |
| Delete event | `delete evt` (via `whose uid`) | ✅ Implemented | ~2.4s |
| Delete calendar | `delete cal` | ✅ Implemented (test teardown) | <1s |

## Recurring Events (tested 2026-03-16)

### Creating Recurring Events

AppleScript supports setting recurrence with RRULE syntax at creation time:

```applescript
make new event at end of events with properties {summary:"Weekly Standup", start date:date "July 01, 2026 09:00:00 AM", end date:date "July 01, 2026 09:30:00 AM", recurrence:"FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR"}
```

Reading back: `recurrence of event` returns `"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR"` (Calendar normalizes by adding `INTERVAL=1`).

### Occurrence UIDs

**All occurrences of a recurring event share the same UID.** Querying via EventKit returns one event object per occurrence, each with the same `calendarItemIdentifier`. Occurrences are distinguished by their `occurrenceDate` / `startDate`.

This means **UID alone is insufficient to target a specific occurrence** — you need UID + date.

### Modification Behavior (AppleScript)

**Modifying the series event modifies ALL occurrences.** When using `whose uid is "..."` to find a recurring event and setting a property (e.g., `set summary`), all occurrences are updated. AppleScript does not offer a way to modify a single occurrence through `whose uid`.

**Deleting via `item N of matchingEvents` removes a single occurrence.** When `whose uid` returns multiple items (one per occurrence), deleting `item 1` removes only that occurrence (adds it to excluded dates). However, `delete (every event whose uid is ...)` does NOT delete the entire series — it only removes visible occurrences, and the series regenerates new ones. To fully remove a recurring series, delete the calendar and recreate it, or use EventKit's `remove(_:span:)` with `.futureEvents`.

### EventKit Properties

Each occurrence exposes:
- `hasRecurrenceRules`: `true` — the occurrence belongs to a recurring series
- `isDetached`: `false` — not individually modified (would be `true` for detached occurrences)
- `occurrenceDate`: the specific date of this occurrence (ISO 8601)
- `recurrenceRules`: array containing the RRULE (e.g., `FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR`)

### Implications for API Design

1. **Read support**: Extend Swift helper to return `recurrence_rule`, `is_recurring`, and `occurrence_date` fields
2. **Create support**: Add optional `recurrence_rule` parameter (RRULE string) to `create_event`
3. **Update behavior**: Updating by UID modifies the entire series. To modify a single occurrence, EventKit's `save(_:span:)` with `.thisEvent` span is needed (not available via AppleScript)
4. **Delete behavior**: Current `delete_events` with `whose uid` + `delete` removes one occurrence. Deleting all matching events removes the series. Consider adding a `delete_series` flag.
5. **Occurrence identification**: Need UID + occurrence_date to uniquely identify an occurrence

### EventKit Save Behavior with Recurring Events (tested 2026-03-17)

**Changing date/time with `.thisEvent` DELETES the occurrence.** When saving a recurring event occurrence with modified start/end dates using `span: .thisEvent`, EventKit removes that occurrence entirely rather than detaching it. The series continues with the remaining occurrences, but the modified one is gone. This is why #82 (updating start/end strips recurrence) happens — the occurrence disappears.

**Changing non-date fields with `.thisEvent` works correctly.** Summary, location, description, etc. can be modified on a single occurrence using `.thisEvent` span. The occurrence is detached from the series and retains its changes.

**Adding recurrence to a non-recurring event WORKS.** Call `event.addRecurrenceRule(rule)` then `store.save(event, span: .thisEvent)`. The event becomes recurring with the specified rule. Verified: a one-off event gained 3 weekly occurrences after adding a rule.

**Removing recurrence from a recurring event WORKS.** Call `event.removeRecurrenceRule(rule)` for each rule, then `store.save(event, span: .futureEvents)`. The event becomes a one-off. Verified: 3 occurrences collapsed to 1.

### Advanced RRULE Features in EventKit (tested 2026-03-17)

**Nth weekday of month WORKS.** `EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek(.monday, weekNumber: 4)` correctly produces 4th Monday recurrence. Verified: Jan 26 → Feb 28 → Mar 27 (all 4th Mondays). Our `parseRecurrenceRule()` just needs to parse the numeric prefix from BYDAY values.

**UNTIL end date WORKS.** `EKRecurrenceEnd(end: date)` correctly limits recurrence. Verified: weekly starting Mar 1 with UNTIL Mar 22 produced 3 occurrences (Mar 1, 8, 15). Our parser just needs to handle the UNTIL key.

### Fix Strategy for Issues #79-#84

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| #79 BYDAY=NXX ignored | Parser doesn't extract numeric prefix | Parse `4MO` → `EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek(.monday, weekNumber: 4)` |
| #80 Can't modify recurrence | `update_event` lacks recurrence_rule param | Add `--recurrence` and `--clear-recurrence` to update_event.swift |
| #81 UNTIL ignored | Parser doesn't handle UNTIL key | Parse UNTIL date → `EKRecurrenceEnd(end: date)` |
| #82 Date change strips recurrence | `.thisEvent` save with date change deletes occurrence | For date changes on recurring events: warn user, or use `.futureEvents`, or re-apply recurrence rule after save |
| #83 Can't safely bulk-update alerts | Depends on #82 fix | After #82, `.futureEvents` save should work for alert-only changes |
| #84 Delete behavior unclear | Documentation gap | Document: `.thisEvent` deletes one occurrence, `.futureEvents` deletes series from that point |

## Attendees (tested 2026-03-16)

### AppleScript

- **Read:** `count of attendees of event` ✅, `email of attendee` ✅, `display name of attendee` ✅ (may be `missing value`), `participation status of attendee` ✅ (returns `accepted`, `unknown`, etc.)
- **Create:** `make new attendee at end of attendees of event with properties {email:"X"}` ✅ — creates attendee, auto-adds organizer as first attendee

### EventKit

- `EKEvent.attendees` → array of `EKParticipant`
- Properties: `name` (string), `url` (mailto: URL), `participantRole` (enum: 0=unknown, 1=required, etc.), `participantStatus` (enum: 0=unknown, 2=accepted, etc.)

### Notes

- Creating an attendee via AppleScript auto-adds the calendar owner as organizer (attendee 1 with status "accepted")
- Attendee email may be `missing value` for the auto-added organizer
- `display name` is often `missing value` — name comes from contacts, not the event itself

---

## Alerts (tested 2026-03-16)

### AppleScript

- **Read:** `display alarms of event` ✅, `sound alarms of event` ✅
- **Create:** `make new display alarm at end of display alarms of event with properties {trigger interval:-15}` ✅ (negative minutes = before event)
- **Properties:** `trigger interval` (integer, minutes relative to event start, negative = before)

### EventKit

- `EKEvent.alarms` → array of `EKAlarm`
- `EKAlarm.relativeOffset` (Double, seconds relative to event start, negative = before)
- `EKAlarm.type` (enum: 0=display, 1=audio, 2=procedure, 3=email)

### Notes

- Trigger interval in AppleScript is **minutes**, EventKit uses **seconds**
- Default calendar alerts (set in Calendar preferences) appear as alarms on events

---

## Travel Time & Structured Location (updated 2026-03-20)

- **AppleScript:** No `travel time` property found
- **EventKit (public):** `EKEvent.structuredLocation` provides:
  - `title` (string) — location name/address
  - `geoLocation` (CLLocation) — latitude/longitude coordinates
  - `radius` (Double) — geofence radius in meters
- **EventKit (private/undocumented):** Travel time properties exist in runtime headers but are NOT in Apple's public API documentation:
  - `travelTime` (Double, seconds) — read/write travel duration
  - `travelStartLocation` (EKStructuredLocation) — read/write travel origin
  - `durationIncludingTravel` (Double, read-only) — computed total duration including travel
  - `startDateIncludingTravel` (Date, read-only) — adjusted start time accounting for travel
  - `allowsTravelTimeModifications` (Bool, read-only) — whether calendar permits travel time changes
  - `travelRoutingMode` — read-only, routing mode set by Calendar.app (road/transit/walking)
- **Source:** iOS Runtime Headers (github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers, EKEvent.h)
- **Risk:** Writing to undocumented properties may cause data corruption or iCloud/Exchange sync issues. Read-only use has similar risk profile to the calendar description KVC key (safe fallback to nil).
- **Decision:** Not implementing. Revisit if Apple documents these properties publicly (#102).

---

## Calendar Visibility (researched 2026-03-20)

- **AppleScript:** No `visible` or `hidden` property on calendars. AppleScript's Calendar dictionary only exposes `name`, `writable`, `description`, `color`. Attempting to access visibility properties fails silently or errors. Some users resort to UI scripting via System Events (simulating checkbox clicks), but this is fragile and not suitable for production.
- **EventKit (private/undocumented):** `EKCalendar.isHidden` exists in iOS Runtime Headers (getter: `isHidden`, setter: `setHidden:`). This is a display preference, not calendar data — it controls the sidebar checkbox in Calendar.app.
- **Source:** iOS Runtime Headers (github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers, EKCalendar.h), Automators Talk forum, MacScripter discussions.
- **Risk:** Lower than travel time — visibility is a UI preference, not event data. If the property breaks, calendars and events are unaffected (calendar just reappears in the sidebar). However, visibility state may not sync across devices.
- **Decision:** Not implementing. Same private API concern as travel time. Revisit if Apple documents publicly (#104).

---

## Text Search (tested 2026-03-16)

- **AppleScript:** `whose summary contains "X"` ✅ on small calendars. Likely slow/timeout on large calendars (same `whose` clause issue as date filtering).
- **EventKit:** No predicate-based text search. Must fetch events by date range, then filter client-side with `title.localizedCaseInsensitiveContains()`. Fast — 163 matches from 6 months of events in <1s.

### Recommendation

Implement text search in the connector via EventKit: fetch events by date range, filter by text in Python. Similar to `get_availability` pattern.

---

## Attachments (tested 2026-03-16)

- **Not accessible** via EventKit or AppleScript
- `EKEvent` does not expose a file attachments array
- Notes/description field can contain text but not file references
- Calendar.app supports attachments in the UI but the API doesn't expose them

---

## Calendar Properties (tested 2026-03-16)

EventKit exposes additional calendar metadata:
- `EKCalendar.type` — enum: 1=CalDAV, 2=Exchange, 4=Birthday, etc.
- `EKCalendar.isSubscribed` — boolean
- `EKCalendar.isImmutable` — boolean (true for Birthdays, system calendars)
- `EKCalendar.source` — the account/source the calendar belongs to

## Unimplemented Capabilities Audit (2026-03-21)

Comprehensive audit of EventKit and AppleScript capabilities not exposed by the current 10-tool API. Organized by priority.

### P1 — High value, worth implementing

| Capability | API | What it enables | Effort |
|-----------|-----|----------------|--------|
| **Structured Location** (EKStructuredLocation) | EventKit | Geo coordinates (lat/long), radius for geofencing, structured address. Enables location-aware scheduling, map integration, "where's my next meeting?" | High |

Structured location is the most significant unexposed capability. No competitor exposes it. Would add `structured_location: {title, latitude, longitude, radius}` to create_events/update_events and get_events.

### P2 — Medium value, low effort

| Capability | API | What it enables | Effort |
|-----------|-----|----------------|--------|
| **Organizer details** | EventKit (EKEvent.organizer) | Full organizer name/email/status instead of just `is_organizer` boolean | Low |
| **Creation/modified timestamps** | EventKit (EKEvent.creationDate, lastModifiedDate) | Audit trails, sync conflict detection | Low |
| **Default calendar** | EventKit (EKEventStore.defaultCalendarForNewEvents) | Smart defaults when user doesn't specify calendar | Low |

### P3 — Low value, skip

| Capability | API | Why skip |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Fine-grained recurrence parsing | EventKit | RRULE string is standard and sufficient |
| Calendar isImmutable/isSubscribed | EventKit | Type field (subscription/birthday) mostly covers this |
| Event timezone read-back | EventKit | Events created with timezone param; returned in local time |
| Absolute/proximity alarms | EventKit | Advanced; relative offset covers 99% of use cases |
| All sources list | EventKit | Source field on calendars sufficient |
| UI operations (reveal, openLocation) | AppleScript | Automation, not scheduling |

### Out of scope

| Capability | API | Why excluded |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Reminders (EKReminder) | EventKit | Separate entity type; Reminders.app is primary consumer. Would bloat tool surface. |
| Travel time | EventKit (private) | Not in public API docs; sync risk (#102) |
| Calendar visibility | EventKit (private) | Not in public API docs; UI preference only (#104) |
| Attendee write | EventKit (read-only) | EventKit limitation; must use email invitations |
| Event attachments | Neither | Not exposed by EventKit or AppleScript |

### Already complete (no gap)

| Capability | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Availability states (busy/free/tentative/unavailable/not_supported) | All 5 exposed |
| Attendees (name, email, role, status) | Full read-only access |
| Recurrence (RRULE create/update/delete, occurrence targeting, reschedule) | Complete |
| Calendar source/account | Exposed in v0.7.0 |
| All-day event handling | Inclusive end_date in v0.7.0 |
| Batch operations | create_events + update_events |
| Conflict detection | get_conflicts tool |
| Smart availability | Working hours + min duration filters |
