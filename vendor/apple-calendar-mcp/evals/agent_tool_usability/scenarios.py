"""Blind agent eval scenarios for Apple Calendar MCP tool usability.

Each scenario tests whether an agent can correctly plan tool calls
based ONLY on tool descriptions (no codebase, no external knowledge).

Scoring Rubric
--------------
PASS (2 pts): Correct tool(s) called with all critical parameters correct.
PARTIAL (1 pt): Correct primary tool(s) called, at least one required
    parameter correct, at most one critical parameter wrong or missing.
    For batch operations, N separate single-event calls = PARTIAL.
FAIL (0 pts): Wrong tool selected, or critical parameters entirely wrong.
    Wrong tool selection is always FAIL, never PARTIAL.
MANUAL: Scenario requires human judgment (e.g., under-specified requests
    where the expected behavior is to ask for clarification).

Automated scoring checks tool-name presence and key-param mentions in the
response text. It is rule-based (not model-based) to avoid self-scoring bias.
